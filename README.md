# Photo Gallery

This website was inspired by the [pixabay] and [unsplash] were people can share their picture which any user can use for their projects (open source), they can also like and share it with their friends. The website is really simple no frontend framework has been used. Maybe in the future, I will implement it in a Vue.js framework.This website is from users who are beginners and want to know how to apply  CRUD operations and how to upload an image to a database and how to display it in a card view.And the images that have been use in this project are from [pixabay].

# Features

  - User can upload images along side with their title and categorie 
  - User can search for a picture from a specific type of categorie
  - User can also perform CRUD operations (Create Read Update Delete)
  - User can also download the images 
  - User can also like someone elses post 
  - User also has a simple dashboard
  - User can see notification after and operation has been preformed

### Tech

Photo Gallery uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Laravel] - PHP based framework!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [javascript](www.javascript.com) - makes the website lightweight and great from animations
* [MySQL] - the most simple , easy and free database that exist
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Photo Gallery itself is open source .

### Installation

Photo Gallery requires [Laravel] v5.7.6+ to run.

Download the project from the repo and then run these commands.

```sh
$ composer update 
$ php artisan serve
```
Once the server is running got to your .env file and change the database name and password to your database name and password.Database has also been added in the Database folder.
